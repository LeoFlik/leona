# Code Morse Project
## Portifolio Project

This is the first project from the 100 days of Python curse after the regular modules. Now we are supposed to code without any tutorial, in order to develop our dave skills.

### Getting the Data:

In order to practicing my webscraper skill, as well as how to use the Pandas lib, I get my code morse dictionary from this webpage <a href = 'https://morsedecoder.com/morse-code-alphabet/'> Morse Code Alphabet </a>. I`ve treated the data and change it into a dictonary to export to my main file.
